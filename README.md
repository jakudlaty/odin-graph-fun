# 🎡 graph-fun

![graph-fun screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

Welcome to **graph-fun**, a quirky and interactive graph dynamics simulation built with [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
It's a digital playground where nodes live, breathe, and occasionally "shiver" apart to find their happy place!
I wrote it to have some fun with odin language and raylib.

## 🛠️ How to Build

First, make sure you have the [Odin compiler](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) and [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) installed on your system.

### 🐧 Linux
Simply run the shell script:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./graph-fun
```

### 🪟 Windows
Run the batch file in your terminal:
```cmd
build.bat
graph-fun.exe
```

## 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **LMB** | Add a new node |
| **RMB** | Break a connection |
| **Slider** | Change equilibrium distance |
| **R / C** | **Reset** everything (Nuclear option!) |

## 🚀 Fun Experiments to Try
1. **The Web**: Connect many nodes and watch them settle into a beautiful lattice.
2. **The Stress Test**: Set the distance slider to the minimum and watch the graph crumble under pressure.
3. **The Expansion**: Set distance to 500 and watch your structure explode into a giant network.

Have fun playing with **graph-fun**! 🎢
